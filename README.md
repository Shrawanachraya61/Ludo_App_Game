Further work on this app is being done in Unity [here](<https://github.com/burhanhaq/Ludo_App_Game_Unity/>).

## Inspiration
My main motivation for making another shrawan game was to actually implement a die that didn't have rigged values. Other Ludo games would not make use of a pure random die and so would output absurb possibilities of numbers. I set out to stop that once and for all!
